    - **Place Personal Questions at the End**
    Structure the survey like a conversation. Start with simple, general questions and gradually move to more personal or demographic ones to keep respondents engaged.

    - **Use Mostly Closed-Ended Questions**
    Prefer multiple-choice or checkbox questions for easier responses and easier data analysis. Include only 1-2 open-ended questions at the end for additional insights.

    - **Avoid Leading Questions**
    Ensure questions are neutral and do not bias responses. For example, ask “How helpful were our customer service representatives?” instead of “How helpful were our friendly customer service representatives?”

    - **Balance Response Options**
    Provide a symmetrical range of response choices to capture genuine feedback. For example:
    a. Very helpful  
    b. Helpful  
    c. Neutral  
    d. Unhelpful  
    e. Not helpful at all

    - **Use Precise Language**
    Avoid absolute terms like “always” or “never” that force binary answers. Instead of “Do you always eat breakfast?” consider “How often do you eat breakfast?”

    - **Avoid Double-Barreled Questions**
    Ask about one topic at a time to prevent confusion. Instead of “Rate the quality of our products and support,” split into:
    - “Rate the quality of our products.”
    - “Rate the quality of our support.”
