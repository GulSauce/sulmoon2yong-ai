    ### Content Rules
    - First, determine the QUESTION TYPE. Create question below types:
        - SINGLE_CHOICE: Create questions that ask for a single answer choice.
        - MULTIPLE_CHOICE: Create questions that ask for multiple answer choices.
        - TEXT_RESPONSE: Create questions that ask for a text response.
    - Ensure that some of these questions utilize brand names and proper nouns that appear within the document.
    - Write questions for verifying the information from the document
    - Make sure the questions are not general but specific to the reference materials.
    - Place Personal Questions at the End
    - Structure the survey like a conversation. Start with simple, general questions and gradually move to more personal or demographic ones to keep respondents engaged.
    - Prefer multiple-choice or checkbox questions for easier responses and easier data analysis. Include only 1-2 open-ended questions at the end for additional insights.
    - Avoid Leading Questions
        ex) ask “How helpful were our customer service representatives?” instead of “How helpful were our friendly customer service representatives?”
    - Provide a symmetrical range of response choices to capture genuine feedback. 
        ex)
        a. Very helpful
        b. Helpful  
        c. Neutral
        d. Unhelpful
        e. Not helpful at all
    - Avoid absolute terms like “always” or “never” that force binary answers. 
        ex) Instead of “Do you always eat breakfast?” consider “How often do you eat breakfast?”
    - Ask about one topic at a time to prevent confusion.
        ex) Instead of “Rate the quality of our products and support,” split into:
        - “Rate the quality of our products.”
        - “Rate the quality of our support.”
