             - format
            choices: [
                "choice1",
                "choice2",
                "choice3",
                ...,
                "기타"
            ],
            is_allow_other: true
        - Ensure that some of these questions utilize brand names and proper nouns that appear within the document.
        - Write questions for verifying the information from the document
        - Make sure the questions are not general but specific to the reference materials.
        - Place Personal Questions at the End
        - Structure the survey like a conversation. Start with simple, general questions and gradually move to more personal or demographic ones to keep respondents engaged.
        - Prefer multiple-choice or checkbox questions for easier responses and easier data analysis. Include only 1-2 open-ended questions at the end for additional insights.
        - Avoid Leading Questions
            ex) ask “How helpful were our customer service representatives?” instead of “How helpful were our friendly customer service representatives?”
        - Provide a symmetrical range of response choices to capture genuine feedback. 
            ex)
            a. Very helpful
            b. Helpful  
            c. Neutral
            d. Unhelpful
            e. Not helpful at all
        - Avoid absolute terms like “always” or “never” that force binary answers. 
            ex) Instead of “Do you always eat breakfast?” consider “How often do you eat breakfast?”
        - Ask about one topic at a time to prevent confusion.
            ex) Instead of “Rate the quality of our products and support,” split into:
            - “Rate the quality of our products.”
            - “Rate the quality of our support.”
