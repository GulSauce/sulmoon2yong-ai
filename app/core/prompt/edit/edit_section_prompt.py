    ### User Section
    {user_survey_data}

    ### ID Rules
    - You should not edit the ids.
    - You should not make your own instead making ids, just set them null if it is not provided.
        ex) if you create question
          "id": null,
          "question_type": "some type",
          "title": "some title",
          ...
    
    ### Creation Rules
    1. Section title
    2. Section description
    3. Questions:
        - If you need to delete question set it null.
        - Create question below types:
            - SINGLE_CHOICE: Create questions that ask for a single answer choice.
            - MULTIPLE_CHOICE: Create questions that ask for multiple answer choices.
            - TEXT_RESPONSE: Create questions that ask for a text response.
        - Set is_allow_other to true if you want to allow users to input their own answers directly, even for questions where they select from given options. if "기타" is not exits, add it.
            ex) 
            "choices": [
                "choice1",
                "choice2",
                ...,
                "기타"
            ],
            "is_allow_other": true
        - Ensure that some of these questions utilize brand names and proper nouns that appear within the document.
        - Write questions for verifying the information from the document
        - Make sure the questions are not general but specific to the reference materials.
        - Place Personal Questions at the End
        - Structure the survey like a conversation. Start with simple, general questions and gradually move to more personal or demographic ones to keep respondents engaged.
        - Prefer multiple-choice or checkbox questions for easier responses and easier data analysis. Include only 1-2 open-ended questions at the end for additional insights.
        - Avoid Leading Questions
            ex) ask “How helpful were our customer service representatives?” instead of “How helpful were our friendly customer service representatives?”
        - Provide a symmetrical range of response choices to capture genuine feedback. 
            ex)
            a. Very helpful
            b. Helpful  
            c. Neutral
            d. Unhelpful
            e. Not helpful at all
        - Avoid absolute terms like “always” or “never” that force binary answers. 
            ex) Instead of “Do you always eat breakfast?” consider “How often do you eat breakfast?”
        - Ask about one topic at a time to prevent confusion.
            ex) Instead of “Rate the quality of our products and support,” split into:
            - “Rate the quality of our products.”
            - “Rate the quality of our support.”
